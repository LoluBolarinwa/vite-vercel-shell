                        Hi, my name is Lolu. Welcome to my Portfolio! <br></br>
                        I build frontend applications using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and REACT.<br></br>
                        While the underlaying blockchain architecture is built using SOLDITY, ETHERS.js and HARDHAT. 
                        With an emphasis on migrating smart contracts to the Zero-Knowledge EVM.

                        My journey into web3 began early winter of 2017 when I cluelessly bought bitcoin
                        and forgot about it. I later on remembered in 2021 and converted it to fiat. This opened my eyes to a store of value that could transform the financial sector. It made me curious.
                        So I researched about the type of internet architecture that kept it secure and running, and found Blockchain in the middle of it all.
                        This led me down the web3 rabbit hole.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Over the past year, I have taken the traditional route of learning web2 technology stack intensively before diving into web3, so as to lay a solid foundation for the 
                        structure of knowledge I will subsequently acquire about this evergrowing space.
